  Description:    Header file for the Sensor Demo application. This application
                  has two device types; Collectors and Sensors. 

                  A collector device functions as Routers and may be configured
                  in gateway mode to accept binding requests from Sensors. The
                  gateway node also forward received sensor reports to its
                  serial port. 

                  The sensors will periodically report sensor data to the 
                  gateway in the system.
